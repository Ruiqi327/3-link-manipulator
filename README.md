2024.6.1 Update (Corrections and explanations)

We are very very very sorry that in the submitted paper, the label of 'SAINA' in experiment 'CASE 3' was miswritten as 'AIFNA'. This does not affect any of the experimental results and conclusions, and we would like to make corrections and clarifications here. We sincerely ask for your forgiveness and apologize for any inconvenience that this mistake caused to you.

2024.5.6 Statement of Originality

All codes are edited by Ruiqi Zhou, which are completely open sourced and can be read, copied and used by anyone.  However, we'd love to kindly suggest you to acknowledge the source when using this code, which will greatly encourage us to continue our open source work. If you have any problem reading this code, feel free to e-mail me at zhouruiqi@stu.scu.edu.cn.

It is worth pointing out that the kinematics dynamics of the manipulator we use are slightly different from those in the relevant literature, but this does not 
affect the control effect. Moreover, in the article, we only use this engineering problem to verify the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. Current version of this
code aims to make it easier for reviewers to evaluate our paper submitted to IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS-II: EXPRESS BRIEFS. When the paper is officially accepted, we shall update a new version with more detailed explanations.
