All codes are completely open sourced and can be read, copied and used by anyone.  However, we'd love to kindly suggest you to acknowledge the source when using this code, 
which will greatly encourage us to continue our open source work. If you have any problem reading this code, feel free to e-mail me at zhouruiqi@stu.scu.edu.cn.

It is worth pointing out that the kinematics dynamics of the manipulator we use are slightly different from those in the relevant literature, but this does not 
affect the control effect. Moreover, in the article, we only use this engineering problem to verify the effectiveness of the designed algorithm. Current version of this
code aims to make it easier for reviewers to evaluate our paper. When the paper is officially accepted, we will update a new version with more detailed explanations.
